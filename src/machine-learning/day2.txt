models:
- linear regression
- logistic regression
- suppport vector machines
ensemble methods
- combining muliple models
- adaboost

logits = logistic regression

combining models:
- have multi models create predictions
-  combine the predictions
        - regression: average
        - classification: most likely predictions
- does it introduce variance?
    - only if bias is correlated

adaboost
- start with one decision treem trained on the whole data set
- see which data points your decision trees do pooorly on
- to get the data point to train the next decisition tree on, sample the dataset, giving more weight to points that your decision forest does pooorly on
    - weight each decision tree by its error rate
- eventually you end up with a well rounded forest
- guaranteed to converge to 100% accuracy
    - if you can get new learners w/ >50% accuracy
